# Valkyrian-anime
The repository for the English translation of the Chinese Starsector mod, Valkyrian with anime portraits.

Except for the portraits, I did not make this mod. All rights excluding the portraits go to the authors, ValkyriaL and Originem.

Portraits were AI generated and then manually edited to fix flaws and improve the overall logic and balance of the images, a process that took between several hours to several days per portrait.
